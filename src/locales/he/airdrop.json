    "failed-solution": "The main cause of a presale transaction failure is a low transaction/gas fee estimation made by your wallet. Some wallets only estimate the gas fee for sending out your BNB, but fails to calculate the gas fee needed by the blockchain to send back the token you're buying to your wallet. To solve this problem easily, just increase your transaction/gas fee when sending BNB to any presale address. Increasing your gas fee doesn't increase the fee the blockchain finally deducts for a transaction. The blockchain will only use what's needed for the transaction, and return the rest to your wallet."
